                        <p>
                            Let us generate a block of amorphous silica (SiO2). To do so,
                            we are going to replicate a building block containing 3 Si and
                            6 O atoms. The data file for the SiO atoms can be downloaded
                            by clicking 
                            <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lammpstutorials/lammpstutorials.github.io/main/inputs/05-FluidCrack/SilicaBlock/SiO.data"

                            in a folder called SilicaBlock. This data
                            file contains the coordinates of the atoms, their masses, and
                            their charges, and can be directly read by LAMMPS using the
                            read_file command. Let us replicate these atoms using LAMMPS,
                            and apply an annealing procedure to obtain a block of
                            amorphous silica.

                            is a bond-angle energy based potential, it deduces the bonds
                            between atoms from their relative positions. Therefore, there
                            is no need to provide bond and angle information as we do with
                            classic force fields like GROMOS or AMBER. Bond-angle energy
                            based potentials are more computationally heavy than classical
                            force fields and require the use of a smaller timestep,
                            but they allow for the modelling of bond formation and breaking,
                            which is what we need here as we want to create a crack in the
                            silica.

                        <p>
                            The system is then replicated four times in all three directions
                            of space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then, let us specify the pair coefficients by indicating
                            that the first atom is Si, and the second is O. Let us also add a
                            dump command for printing out the positions of the atoms every 5000
                            steps:
                            <pre><code># Simulation settings

                        <p>
                            Finally, let us create the last part of our script. The
                            annealing procedure is the following: we first start with a
                            small phase at 6000 K, then cool down the system to 4000 K
                            using a pressure of 100 atm. Then we cool down the system
                            further while also reducing the pressure, then perform a
                            small equilibration step at the final desired condition,
                            300 K and 1 atm.

                            liquid of a gas, use an isotropic barostat instead.

                            Ideally you want to test the validity
                            of the generated structure, for example by measuring the radial
                            distribution function and/or the Young modulus, and compare
                            them to experimental data. This is beyond the scope of this
                            tutorial.

                        <p>
                        We are now going to dilate the block of silica to create a
                        crack. Create a new folder, called Cracking, and create a new input.lammps
                        file starting with:

                        Then, we are going to progressively increase the size of the
                        box over \(z\), thus forcing the silica to crack. To do so,
                        we are going to make a loop using the jump command. At
                        every step of the loop, the box dimension over \(z\) will be
                        multiplied by a factor 1.005. For this step, we use a NVT
                        thermostat because we want to impose a deformation of the volume
                        (therefore NPT would be inappropriate). Add the following lines
                        to the input script:

                            After the dilatation, a final equilibration step of 20
                            picoseconds is performed. If you look at the dump file produced
                            after executing this script, or at

                            adjusting to the box size. At first, the deformations are
                            reversible (elastic regime), but at some point, bonds start
                            breaking and dislocations appear (plastic regime). You can

                        <p>
                        In order to add the water molecules to the silica, we are
                        going to use the Monte Carlo method in the grand canonical
                        ensemble (GCMC). In short, the system is put into contact
                        with a virtual reservoir of given chemical potential \(\mu\),
                        and multiple attempts to insert water molecules at random
                        positions are made. Attempts are either accepted or rejected
                        based on a Monte Carlo acceptance rule.
                        <br><br>
                        In a new folder called Addingwater, add this template file for the water molecule :
                        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lammpstutorials/lammpstutorials.github.io/main/inputs/05-FluidCrack/AddingWater/TIP4P2005.txt"
                        target="_blank" class="removelinkdefault">TIP4P2005.txt</a>.
                        Create a new input file, and copy the following lines into it:
                        <pre><code># Initialization

kspace_style pppm/tip4p 1.0e-4

angle_style harmonic</code></pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        There are several differences with the previous input files
                        used in this tutorial. All these differences are here because 
                        this simulation will combine water and silica. First, we have to
                        combine two force fields, vashishta for SiO, and
                        lj/cut/tip4p/long for TIP4P water model. Combining force
                        fields in LAMMPS can be done using the hybrid/overlay pair
                        style. We also need a kspace solver to solve the long range
                        Coulomb interactions associated with tip4p/long. Finally,
                        we need to define the style for the bond and angle of the
                        water molecules. Some of these features have been seen in
                        a <a href="03-NanoconfinedElectrolyte.html">previous and simpler tutorial</a>.
                        Before going further, we need to make a few change to our
                        data file. Currently, dilatedSiO.data only includes two
                        atom types, but we need four. Copy the previously generated dilatedSiO.data file within 
                        the present folder.

                            We need to make some changes for the addition of water
                            molecules. Modify the file so that it looks like that
                            (the changes are highlighted in bold):

                        <p>
                            Doing so, we anticipate that there will be 4 atoms types in
                            the simulations, with O and H of H2O being indexes 3 and 4,
                            respectively. There will also be 1 bond type and 1 angle
                            type. The extra bond, extra angle, and extra special lines
                            are for memory allocation. Now we can continue to fill the
                            input.lammps file, by adding the system definition:
                            <pre><code># System definition
read_data dilatedSiO.data
molecule h2omol TIP4P2005.txt
create_atoms 0 single 19.5 10 10 mol h2omol 45585

group H2O type 3 4</code></pre>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After reading the data file and defining the h2omol
                            molecule from the txt file, the create atoms command is used
                            to include one single molecule in the system at the location
                            19.5 10 10. I've chosen these 3 values so that the water
                            molecule is initially inside the crack, and not overlapping
                            with SiO atoms, you may have to choose different values.
                            You can estimate these values by looking at your silica
                            structure using VMD. There are cleaner way to do it, such
                            as detecting the free space before inserting the molecule,
                            but for the sake of simplicity, here we are going to do the
                            dirty way here. Not adding a molecule before starting the
                            GCMC steps usually lead to failure. Then,
                            add the following settings of the simulation:
                            <pre><code># Simulation settings

                            The force field vashishta applies only to Si and O of SiO, and
                            not to the O and H of H\(_2\)O thanks to the NULL parameters.
                            Pair coefficients for lj/cut/tip4p/long are defined between
                            O atoms, as well as between O(SiO)-O(H\(_2\)O) and Si(SiO)-O(H\(_2\)O).
                            Finally, the number of oxygen atoms will be printed in the
                            file numbermolecule.dat, and the shake algorithm is used
                            to maintain the shape of the water molecule over time. Some
                            of these features have been seen previously, such as in
                            <a href="03-NanoconfinedElectrolyte.html">this tutorial</a>.

                        <p>
                            Let us make a first equilibration step:
                            <pre><code># Run

                        <p>
                            We use two different thermostats for SiO and H2O, which
                            is better when you have two species, such as one solid and
                            one liquid. It is particularly important to use two
                            thermostats here as the number of water molecules will
                            fluctuate. We use a compute_modify 'dynamic yes' for water
                            to specify that the number of molecules is not constant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, let us use the gcmc fix and perform the grand
                            canonical Monte Carlo step:
                            <pre><code>variable tfac equal 5.0/3.0

                        <p>
                            The tfac_insert option ensures that the correct estimate
                            is made for the temperature of the inserted water molecules
                            by taking into account the internal degrees of freedom.
                            Running this simulation, you should see the number of molecule
                            increasing progressively. Using \(\mu = -0.5\) eV is a
                            reasonable value for the chemical potential that corresponds
                            roughly to ambient conditions (i.e. RH approx 50%).

                            After 250000 steps, There should be about 10 molecules in the 
                            system. This number
                            will vary from one simulation to another, depending on the 
                            space available for insertion. The number of molecules also depends on the imposed chemical
                            potential, temperature, and on the interaction between water and
                            silica. The final state looks like this:

                        <p>
                            This tutorial is already quite complicated, but if you want
                            to go further, there are several interesting things that can be
                            done with this system:

                        <h4>Relative humidity</h4>
                        <p>
                            You can link the imposed chemical potential with the value
                            of relative humidity (RH). For that, you have to calibrate
                            your simulation by measuring the equilibrium amount of water
                            in an empty box for varying imposed chemical potential,
                            see <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.5126481"

                            publication</a> for example.

                        <h4>Isotherm</h4>
                        <p>
                        You can perform a full adsorption isotherm by varying the
                        chemical potential and extracting the equilibrium water
                        content as a function of the imposed RH. Isotherms can be
                        compared to experimental data, and are used sometimes to
                        calibrate force field as it contains a lot of information
                        about the fluid-solid interactions.

                        <h4>Isosteric heat of adsorption</h4>
                        <p>
                            Using the GCMC procedure, you can measure the heat of
                            adsorption by measuring the fluctuations in water molecule
                            and total energy of the system. See this <a target="_blank" class="removelinkdefault"

                        <h4>Hybrid MD/GCMC</h4>
                        <p>
                            In the grand canonical ensemble, the volume of the box is
                            fixed, so its not possible to capture the swelling of a material
                            with its water content (most material swells with water,
                            like sponges). If you want to model the swelling while also
                            performing a GCMC adsorption simulation, you can alternate
                            between GCMC steps and molecular dynamics steps in the NPT
                            ensemble. This method is called hybrid MD/GCMC.
